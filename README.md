# CMPT 353 Final Project

Topic: Investigating Airport Data in North American Airports in the year preceding (and during) the COVID-19 pandemic.

Contributors: Anna Tang, Clement Ip, Erica Ho

## Instructions:

Required Libraries:
```
pip install scipy
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install sklearn
pip install scipy
pip install geopandas
```

Work for each airport can be viewed by running its respective .ipynb notebook file.

## Output

In this project we develop machine learning models that extrapolate and predict how airport traffic will fare in YVR, YEG, YYZ, and YUL during the pandemic. We also analyze the correlation between airport traffic and the number new cases per day, as well as the cumulative number of confirmed cases.
